createAsyncThunk


createAsyncThunk is a utility provided by Redux Toolkit to handle asynchronous operations, like fetching data from an API, in a structured and clean way.


It simplifies managing the three common states of an async operation:

    Pending: The async task has started (e.g., API call is in progress).
    Fulfilled: The async task has completed successfully.
    Rejected: The async task failed (e.g., due to network errors).


Why Use createAsyncThunk?

Traditionally, handling async actions with Redux involved:

 Dispatching separate actions for "loading", "success", and "error".
 Writing lots of boilerplate code to handle these states.

 With createAsyncThunk, Redux Toolkit automatically generates actions for each state (pending, fulfilled, rejected) and simplifies the logic.



How Does createAsyncThunk Work?


1. syntax

const asyncThunk = createAsyncThunk("sliceName/actionName", asyncFunction);


sliceName/actionName: A string identifier for the async action (e.g., "user/fetchUsers").

asyncFunction:  The actual async function to perform the task (e.g., an API call). It can:
Return data on success.
Throw an error or use rejectWithValue on failure.


2. Generated Actions
  When you use createAsyncThunk, Redux Toolkit automatically generates:

    pending action: Dispatched when the async task starts.
    fulfilled action: Dispatched when the async task succeeds.
    rejected action: Dispatched when the async task fails.




 What is builder in extraReducers?
The builder in extraReducers is a functional utility provided by Redux Toolkit that allows you to define how your state changes in response to specific external actions (like those generated by createAsyncThunk).

Instead of writing a massive switch statement to handle actions, the builder provides a chained API to specify how your slice's state should respond to pending, fulfilled, and rejected actions of createAsyncThunk or other external actions.





Reducers 

Handles actions local to the slice (e.g., actions you define within the slice).	

increment, decrement, or toggling a flag.	


Extra Reducers 

Handles external actions (e.g., actions created by createAsyncThunk or actions from other slices).

fetchUsers.pending, fetchUsers.fulfilled, or shared actions.
